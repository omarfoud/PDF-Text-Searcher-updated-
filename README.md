# PDF-Text-Searcher-updated-

A cross-format desktop application for indexing and full-text search over PDF, text, CSV, Excel, JSON, and HTML files (and even web pages). Built with Tkinter GUI and Whoosh search engine, it normalizes and lemmatizes text via NLTK and presents fast, highlighted search results.
